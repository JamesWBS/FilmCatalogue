<!--We will start by creating index.html file. Inside of it, we will load in three scripts
    in the head element pointing to their respective CDN â€“ the React, ReactDOM and Babel. 
    Then, we will create an empty div element and give it an id of root. 
    This is where our application will live. Lastly, we will create a script element
    where we will write our React code.-->
